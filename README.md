# QOI Image Tools

This project is a personal attempt to create a set of tools for QOI (.qoi) images, and is inspired by Reducible's YouTube video entitled [How PNG Works: Compromising Speed for Quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFUYNoFRHQI).

Currently, the project contains the following tools:
- Encoder
- Decoder
- Viewer
