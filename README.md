# QOI Image Tools

This project is a personal attempt to create a set of tools for QOI (.qoi) images, and is inspired by Reducible's YouTube video entitled [How PNG Works: Compromising Speed for Quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFUYNoFRHQI).

Currently, the project contains the following:
- C++ Header for a QOI Decoder `qoi_decoder.hpp`.
- C++ Header for a QOI Encoder `qoi_encoder.hpp`.
- Collection of source code for an executable that can convert an image file to QOI format, and view a QOI image in a custom-made viewer application.

## Usage
### Encoder/Decoder
Download `qoi_decoder.hpp` and/or `qoi_encoder.hpp`, and include them to your C++ project.
